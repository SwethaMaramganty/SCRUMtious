The keystore should not be given to anyone, the keystore.jks file should not even be here. Since this is a group project however, I will leave the password for the keystore here in case anyone needs it. The password was used to sign the APK.

To install the app, just copy the apk to your Android device and install it by clicking on the app in the folder you moved the APK into.

All password fields had the same password when generating the APK:
- Password: SCRUMtious
- Organization Name: SCRUMtious
- City: Toronto
- Country Code: CA
- First and Last Names were left blank
- Organization type was also left blank
