# What are some new practices that you want to try?
  - If we're doing a remote meeting, everyone needs to be at the meeting 
  - At the beginning of each sprint, we should refactor code and review everything
  
# What are any harmful practices that you should stop for the next sprint?
  - One poor practice that we should stop is meeting up for a short period of time every week because it is difficult to stay on track. 
  - It is very easy to get distracted when you're working with friends, so we need to organize our free time and work time. 
  
# What was your best/worst experience during Sprint 1?
