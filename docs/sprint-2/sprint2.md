# Meeting Details
The meeting was held with the purpose of discussing details surrounding sprint 2.

First, we decided on the velocity for this sprint. After careful consideration, and using the previous sprint as reference, we felt it was 
appropriate to go with 23. The following user stories were

# General Breakdown for each User Story in Sprint
We decided on a general approach to breaking down user stories into tasks.
Each user story feature involved could be broken down into activities, presenters, layouts, and the interfaces for the activities and presenters.
As such, we decided to split user stories in this manner, to spread the work out as fairly as possible. Specifics for who does what task would be
recorded on Pivotal Tracker.
