# General Breakdown for each User Story in Sprint
We decided on a general approach to breaking down user stories into tasks.
Each user story feature involved could be broken down into activities, presenters, layouts, and the interfaces for the activities and presenters.
As such, we decided to split user stories in this manner, to spread the work out as fairly as possible. Specifics for who does what task would be
recorded on Pivotal Tracker.
