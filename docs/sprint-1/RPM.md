# Meeting Details

This release consists of a total of 3 sprints, as the project has outlined for us. As such, we discussed thr larger scope of this project. The
ultimate goal of this project is the release, which concludes the development of this app at the end of March. 

Since this is the first sprint, there was not anything from any previous iterations that will affect future development. For the most part, we
all agreed on the things we planned during sprint 0.

As a team, we made sure to discuss the general timeline for the iterations. The first sprint ends on the 15th, and that will be our main focus
in this iteration as a result. Then we have iterations that end on March 8th, and March 22nd. The final presentation was understood to be 
on the 29th of March. This is essentially the date of the release, where all feautures must be implemented and presented.

As for the backlog for this release, it would contain essentially all of the user stories as we have only planned for exactly one release. The current 
velocity was agreed upon as 22 for sprint 1, and will be changed as we proceed with the other iterations as necessary.

We then discussed potential issues for the release. Concerns included things such as finding the right time to meet up, as well as understanding
the technology needed to develop the Android app. We decided to meet on weekends to work on development, and to take some time out of our schedule
before we meet to learn the basics of Android and Android Studio.

Finally, we concluded the release planning meeting by discussing methods of communication, and how we can reach each other. These channels included
Facebook Messenger, Discord, and in real life. In this manner we can all stay updated on what needs doing.
