### Live presentation

To be presented in class according to the schedule you have signed up for

Your presentation should include the following items (in any order you see fit):

 * Product (3-4 minutes)
   * Introduce your product.
   * Highlight the feature(s) that make it unique as opposed to the competition
   * Short live demo.
 * Process (2-3 minutes)
   * Introduce the team - Each member should say 2-3 sentences about their individual contribution to the team.
   * Mention some of the highlights of your process(es).     
     For example: Using GitHub, communicating, scheduling, any standards/conventions you have developed.
   * Tell us about difficulties you faced, working together as a team (i.e. identify some of the team's decisions that, in hindsight, caused the team to be inefficient).
   * Tell us about standards/conventions/techniques that worked well for your team (i.e. identify some of the team's decisions that, in hindsight, helped the team work efficiently).
 * Software Architecture (2-3 minutes)
   * Run us through the way your software is built - What are its main components? What are their responsibilities? How do they interact with one another?
   * Tell us about the technologies and tools that you used.
   * Mention interesting technical challenges you faced, and/or interesting software techniques that you used. 

Other instructions:
 * Suggestion: Prepare the presentation in two steps:
   1. Decide _what_ content you want to present.
   2. Decide _how_ to organize the content to create a presentation with a natural flow.
 * The total time of the presentation (including questions) is __at most 15 minutes__.
   * The time limit is strict.
   * During your presentation, we might ask you a question or two. Make sure you leave some time for that.     
     That is, you should be able to present all of the content in 12 minutes.
 * It is up to you to decide which team member(s) get to present.

### Participation 
 * Specify your team name and the question to the presenter clearly (examle: Team1 here, my question to Team2 is ....)
 * The question must be relevant to the topic being presented 

### `presentation/Reflection.md`

A reflection on the software development processes your team ended up using.

 * Max' 500 words.
 * Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that worked well for your team. Explain why.
 * Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that didn't work well for your team. Explain why.
 * If you had to continue working as a team, and design your process, what would your process look like?     
   In other words, describe an ideal process __for your team__, based on your experience working together.
