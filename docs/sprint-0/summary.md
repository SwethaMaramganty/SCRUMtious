# Objective:
An Android app that helps manage the logistics of remote teams working on projects in a Agile Scrum environment. We keep track of their user stories, tasks, sprint backlog, product backlog, amongst many other things.

# Key Users:
* Scrum master
  - The individual who sets up the project and has admin rights over the project
  - Can edit and add user stories, tasks, and other elements
* Team member
  - The standard user of the app
  - Is invited to the group by the Scrum Master 
  - Can interact with the tasks and view other aspects of the project
  - Does not have admin rights over the project (i.e. cannot add user stories or other team members)

# Scenarios:
* “John is the team leader in a software engineering project. He wants to get a sense of the team’s progress on the current sprint, and see how well the other members are doing their jobs in terms of work. John requires an app that will help him accomplish just this.”
* “Sarah is a team member working on a software engineering project. She was sick one day, and couldn’t attend the daily meeting. As such, she needs an app to view the task board of a particular user story she was working on, to understand how the rest of the team is faring.”

# Principles:
* Maintain a very minimalist user interface, that allows for ease of access
* Architecture of software should be easily understood and should flow well, allowing for modularity
* Coding standards are well understood by teammates (naming conventions, ideas on architecture, etc.)
