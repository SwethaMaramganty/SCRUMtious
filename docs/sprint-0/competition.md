# Name of competitor app: Scrum App

## Short description: 
The app allows for the user to create a scrum project, where they manage sprints. Users are able to create user stories and move them between the product backlog and the sprint backlog. Tasks can be created for each user story, and can be viewed on a task board. Progress is charted on a burndown chart.

# Name of competitor app: Asana

## Link to app: 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asana.app&hl=en

## Short description: 
Asana allows for group collaboration through setting up tasks, and maintaining conversations between members. Allows users to set up reminders due dates for tasks, notifying team members when tasks are completed. Asana takes a general approach to the group collaboration.

# How our app would be different/better: 
Our app will unify ideas from both of the competitor apps to create a fluid and easy to use scrum management Android app. The first app suffers from a lack of good design. It is confusing for a user of the app to add and manage user stories. Scrum App does not have the ability to collaborate with other members in real time, something our app would do seamlessly. In addition, the UI does not look very appealing in Scrum App. We would aim to make a very lightweight application with a very minimal feel. The users of our app would not be overwhelmed at all, thanks to the friendly user interface. Asana on the other hand differs from what we envision for our app, mainly due to the fact that Asana takes a more general approach to team collaboration. There is no notion of a sprint or user story in that app. While the UI for Asana is very simplistic, it can still be confusing to add team members onto a project. 

Our app would contain two different types of users instead of just one. The other apps generally have only one type of user (the general team member), but we have a scrum master and a standard team member using the app. The scrum master is responsible for setting up sprints, creating user stories, as well as assigning tasks. This is one major area in which our app differs from the competition.
